# Horizontal Gene Transfer Detection
This repository contains the implementation of the distribution algorithm presented in my bachelors thesis. It can detect horizontal gene transfers by looking at the distances between all genes, comparing those distances to the expected distribution of distances, and returning extreme deviations.
